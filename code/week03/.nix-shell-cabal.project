-- These packages appear in our dependency tree and are very slow to build.
-- Empirically, turning off optimization shaves off ~50% build time.
-- It also mildly improves recompilation avoidance.
-- For deve work we don't care about performance so much, so this is okay.

-- Compared to others, cardano-wallet doesn't bump dependencies very often.
-- Making it a good place to start when bumping dependencies.
-- As, for example, bumping the node first highly risks breaking API with the wallet.
-- Unless early bug fixes are required, this is fine as the wallet tracks stable releases of the node.
-- And it is indeed nice for plutus-apps to track stable releases of the node too.
